# py4e
completing the py4e class to build upon fundamentals
started about a month or so ago, but never committed to the idea of finishing it. I ordered the automate things with py book and barely looked at it. After this course, I plan to read the other book and complete it fully. I will upload to Git Hub every day and work on my coding, even if it's very little.
